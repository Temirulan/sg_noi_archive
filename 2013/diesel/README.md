# Background
The problem diesel was found to be misleading/incorrectly set after the contest. The Scientific Committee thus decided to award the maximum score obtainable if one can obtain correct outputs for EITHER testdata (testdata_rounded and testdata_unrounded).
It is thus not recommended to try this question for practice.
